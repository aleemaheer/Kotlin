## Learning Kotlin
As a software enginner, I am not limited to any technology or programming language. I am always learning different technologies and programming languages.
* In this repository, I am learning Kotlin. You can join me too.

### How to run Kotlin code
For Mac and Linux:
* Install Kotlin compiler
* Compile the code using `kotlinc <filename>.kt -include-runtime -d <filename>.jar`
* Run the binaries that are produced by the above command `kotlin -classpath <filename>.jar <filename>.jar`
* Run the code using `java -jar <filename>.jar` or `kotlin -classpath <filename>.jar <filename>`

For Windows:
